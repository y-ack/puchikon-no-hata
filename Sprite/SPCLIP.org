* SPCLIP
Controls which part of the screen sprites are visible in.
Sprites that go outside this area will be cut off.

** Syntax
# use haskell as language for syntax examples as a gross workaround for github being the worst
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
SPCLIP [start_x%, start_y%, end_x%, end_y%]
#+END_SRC

If no arguments are passed, the sprite display area covers the entire screen.

More precisely, the visible area starts at ( start_x%, start_y% ) and ends at ( start_x%-1, start_y%-1 )
If the end is less than the start, they are swapped.


** Examples
#+BEGIN_SRC smilebasic
SPCLIP 200,0, 400-1,240-1
'only sprites on the right half of the screen are visible
FOR I=0 TO 99
  SPSET I,0
  SPOFS I,RND(400),RND(240)
NEXT
#+END_SRC
