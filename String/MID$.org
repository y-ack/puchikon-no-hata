* MID$
Extract characters from a string, starting on the specified =pos%= of the string.

** Syntax
# use haskell as language for syntax examples as a gross workaround for github being the worst
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
MID$ string$, pos%, length% OUT substring$
#+END_SRC

# if alternate syntax is needed, list it in the same way. Use OUT for one-return forms

# describe the arguments here, if necessary.  at minimum, describe types
| Parameter | Description |
|-----------+-------------|
| =string$= | A string. |
| =pos%= | Position on =string$= to start extracting characters.|
| =length%= | The number of characters to extract, starting from =pos%=. Can't be less than 0. |
# if the output is nontrivial or has interesting properties:
| Output    | Description       |
|-----------+-------------------|
| =substring$= | The extracted characters from =string$= |

If =pos%= is bigger than the length of =string$=, the function does not trigger an error. Instead, returns nothing.

** Examples
#+BEGIN_SRC smilebasic
PRINT MID$("TEST",1,2) ' ES
PRINT MID$("12345",3,1) ' 4
#+END_SRC

** Possible Errors
# Detail errors one might get from the instruction, with a focus on making the resolution clear
| Error | Cause |
|-------+-------|
| Out of range | =length%= is less than 0, or =pos%= is less than 0. |
