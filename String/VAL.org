* VAL
Converts a string to a number.

** Syntax
# use haskell as language for syntax examples as a gross workaround for github being the worst
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
VAL string$ OUT number
#+END_SRC

# if alternate syntax is needed, list it in the same way. Use OUT for one-return forms

# describe the arguments here, if necessary.  at minimum, describe types
| Parameter | Description |
|-----------+-------------|
| string$ | A string containing a number. |

Any number format that SB supports can be used.

=VAL= has weird restrictions:

- Spaces before the number are allowed.
- If the number is a hexadecimal or binary integer (=&B...= or =&H...=), a line break or comma followed by any characters is allowed after the number.
- If the number is a decimal integer, =!= is also allowed.
- If the number is a float ending with =.= or =#=, any characters are allowed after the number.
- If the number is any other float, any characters except =E= and =e= are allowed after the number.

** Examples
#+BEGIN_SRC smilebasic
PRINT VAL("10")
PRINT VAL("&HDEADBEEF")
#+END_SRC
