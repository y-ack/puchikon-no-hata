* LEFT$
Extract characters from the left side of a string

** Syntax
# use haskell as language for syntax examples as a gross workaround for github being the worst
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
LEFT$ string$, length% OUT substring$
#+END_SRC

# if alternate syntax is needed, list it in the same way. Use OUT for one-return forms

# describe the arguments here, if necessary.  at minimum, describe types
| Parameter | Description |
|-----------+-------------|
| =string$= | A string |
| =length%= | The number of characters to extract. Can't be less than 0. If greater than the length of =string$=, the entire string is returned. |
# if the output is nontrivial or has interesting properties:
| Output    | Description       |
|-----------+-------------------|
| =substring$= | The leftmost =length%= characters of =string$= |
=LEFT$= always returns a new string, even if =length%= is greater than or equal to the length of =string$=.

** Examples
#+BEGIN_SRC smilebasic
PRINT LEFT$("TEST",2) ' TE
PRINT LEFT$("AAAAA",200) ' AAAAA
#+END_SRC

** Possible Errors
# Detail errors one might get from the instruction, with a focus on making the resolution clear
