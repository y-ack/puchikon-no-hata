* STR$
Converts a number to a string.

** Syntax
# use haskell as language for syntax examples as a gross workaround for github being the worst
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
STR$ number [, lengt​h%] OUT string$
#+END_SRC

# if alternate syntax is needed, list it in the same way. Use OUT for one-return forms

# describe the arguments here, if necessary.  at minimum, describe types
| Parameter | Description |
|-----------+-------------|
| number | If this is a float, STR$ will print at most 6 significant figures, using scientific notation if nessesary. |
| length% | If the length of the output is shorter than this, spaces will be added to the beginning of the string |

=STR$= uses the formatting code =%.6g= for floats and =%d= for integers.

** Examples
#+BEGIN_SRC smilebasic
SCORE=1000
PRINT "SCORE: "+STR$(SCORE) 'SCORE: 1000
#+END_SRC
