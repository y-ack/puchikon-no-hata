* SUBSTR$
Inserts a string in another string, with optional character substitution.

** Syntax 
# use haskell as language for syntax examples as a gross workaround for github being the worst
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
SUBSTR$ target$, pos%, substitute$ OUT result$
SUBSTR$ target$, pos%, [numberofchars%,] substitute$ OUT result$
#+END_SRC

# if alternate syntax is needed, list it in the same way. Use OUT for one-return forms
 
# describe the arguments here, if necessary.  at minimum, describe types
| Parameter | Description |
|-----------+-------------|
| =target$= | A string. |
| =pos%= | Position on =target$= to place =substitute$=. Can be the length of =target$=. |
| =numberofchars%= | Number of characters to replace after =pos%=. |
| =substitute$= | A character or string to insert. |
# if the output is nontrivial or has interesting properties:
| Output    | Description       |
|-----------+-------------------|
| =result$= | Resulting string after operation. |

- If =numberofchars%= is omitted, all characters in =target$= after =pos%= will be replaced by =substitute$=, regardless of the length of both strings.
- If =numberofchars%= is 0, =substitute$= will be placed on the given =pos%= and no replacement happends.


** Examples
#+BEGIN_SRC smilebasic
' Substitution
PRINT SUBSTR$("1234567890",1,"#") ' "1#"
PRINT SUBSTR$("12345",0,1,"#") ' "#2345"
PRINT SUBSTR$("12345",1,3,"=") ' "1#5"

' Append
' Append at the end
PRINT SUBSTR$("123",3,"_ABC") ' "123_ABC"
' Append at the beginning
PRINT SUBSTR$("ABC",0,0,"DEF") ' "DEFABC"
' Append at the middle
PRINT SUBSTR$("12345",2,0,"//") ' "12//345"
#+END_SRC


** Possible Errors
# Detail errors one might get from the instruction, with a focus on making the resolution clear
| Error | Cause |
|-------+-------|
| Out of range | =pos%= is less than 0, or bigger than the length of =target$=. Or =numberofchars%= is less than 0. |
